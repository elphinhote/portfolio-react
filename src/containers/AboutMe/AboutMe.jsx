              As a professional, I feel like I've always been one of the lucky
              ones who enjoys getting up for work everyday. I've been blessed to
              have flexibility to choose where & what I work on. As technology
              continues to advance, I get more excited about what I do.
            </p>

              Recently, I've chosen to move from the business development side
              of IT into being more directly involved with technology. I'm
              current enrolled in Georgia Tech's Software Development Boot Camp.
              Curriculum here:
              https://bootcamp.pe.gatech.edu/coding/curriculum/. I will graduate
              on May 18th, and will be ready to immediately jump into a Jr.
              Developer role.{" "}

              In my personal life, I'm a husband, and a father to 3 wonderful
              kids. We love Atlanta, but we also have roots across the west. We
              would consider jobs locally, on the Pacific Coast, or in the
              Mountain West.{" "}
